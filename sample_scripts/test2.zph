uint p,q,n

if there is no q in [2..x-1] with p mod q=0 then p is prime
if p mod (q*n)=0 then p mod q=0

if n<=2 then fib(n)=1 else fib(n)=fib(n-1)+fib(n-2)

window1 = window("Test", size(500,500))

frame1 = frame(500,500)

plot color(50,50,50) at 100,150 on frame1

show frame1 at 0,0 on window1

r,g,b is red if r>>g and r>>b
r,g,b is yellow if r~g and r>>b

sprite1 = circle(50,50)
fill sprite1 with red at 50,50

show sprite1 at 250,250 on window1

button1 is button

show button1 at 300,300 on window1

if button1 was clicked then move sprite1 by 3,3 on window1

define plot color at coord on frame:
  # use cv::Mat


button is a filled rectangle

thing is filled if color of != color of background of thing

background of thing is average color of
